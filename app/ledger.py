"""Settlement ledger — one SQLite row per successful on-chain payment.

This is a *receipt book*, not custody: the money settles to your wallet
on-chain; this records that the sale happened so you can answer "how many
sales, which routes, how much?" from your own database.

Design notes worth keeping if you adapt this:
    * ``record_payment_event`` is async and never raises — a broken ledger
      must NEVER break a payment that already settled on-chain.
    * The SQLite write runs in a thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) so it doesn't
      block the event loop.
    * ``tx_hash`` is UNIQUE and the insert is ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` — so the
      writer is idempotent: the same settlement recorded twice is a no-op.
